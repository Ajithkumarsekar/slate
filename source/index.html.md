# Introduction

The Unmetric API is an easy way to query information about a brand's social media pages, accounts, metrics and related data. The API gives you the flexibility to feed Unmetric competitive intelligence into your in-house proprietary tools, native social media dashboards, command room screens and more.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# What Can You Do With The Unmetric REST API?
With the Unmetric API, you can:

* Gain a broad overview of a brand's social media activity 
* Trace fan and follower growth over time
* Delve deep into page and account social media performance by day
* Explore content published by the brand and related attributes
* Compare multiple brand profiles across metrics over time
* Get Daily Alerts on interesting brand social activity


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Unmetric uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can request for a new unmetric API key from your account manager.

unmetric API expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a request parameter that looks like the following:

`{uri}?accesstoken=UNMETRICAPIKEY&additional_parameters`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>UNMETRICAPIKEY</code> with your personal API key.
